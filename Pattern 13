Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build the pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15

class Solution {
  public:
    void printTriangle(int n) {
       int sum=1;
       for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
       {
           for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
           { 
              
              cout<<sum<<" ";
              sum++;
             
           }
           cout<<endl;
       }
    }
};
