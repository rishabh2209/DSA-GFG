Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build the pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
ABCDE
ABCD
ABC
AB
A



class Solution {
  public:
    void printTriangle(int n) {
         for(int i=n; i>0; i--)
        {
            for(int j=0; j<i; j++)
            {
                char ch = 'A'+j;
                cout<<ch;
                
            }
            cout<<endl;
        }
    }
};
