Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a  pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:

*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *

Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. Complete the function printTriangle() which takes  an integer n  as the input parameter and print the pattern.

Constraints:

1<= N <= 20

class Solution{
public:
	
void printTriangle(int n) {
	   for(int i=n ; i>0 ; i--)
        {
            for(int s=(n-i) ; s>=1 ; s--)
            {
                cout<<" ";
            }
            for(int j=1 ; j<=2*i-1 ; j++)
            {
                cout<<"*";
            }
            cout<<endl;
        }
	    // code here
	}
};
