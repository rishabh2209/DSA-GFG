Ram is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Ram an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Ram build a pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
E
E D
E D C
E D C B
E D C B A



class Solution {
  public:
    void printTriangle(int n) {
      // code here
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            char ch='A'+n-1;
            for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){
                cout<<ch<<' ';
                ch--;
            }
            cout<<endl;
        }
    }
};
